# Getting Started with Astronomer Airflow: The Data Engineering Workhorse

**What is Astromer Airflow?**

We'll start here with Airflow. Apache Airflow is an open-source workflow management platform that helps you build Data Engineering Pipelines. One of the biggest advantages to Airflow, and why it is so popular, is that you write your configuration in Python in the form of what is referred to as a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). The power of writing a DAG with Python means that you can leverage the powerful suite of Python libraries available to do nearly anything you want.

Next up is Astronomer. Astronomer is a managed Airflow service that allows you to orchestrate workflows in a cloud environment. A common use case for Airflow is taking data from one source, transforming it over several steps, and loading it into a data warehouse. You can even leverage Airflow for Feature Engineering, where you apply data transformations in your Data Warehouse, creating new views of data. In this post, I'll walk through the basics of Airflow and how to get started with Astronomer.
